WINDOW OBJECT:
The window object represents an open window in a browser.The window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser. 
This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.

DOCUMENT OBJECT:
Document is the function(a DOM interface), which will be used to create the document object. 
This "Document" is implemented by the browser program. This takes our HTML file as input and creates the "document" object.

DIFFERNCE BETWEEN OBJECT AND WINDOW:
The document object is your html, aspx, php, or other document that will be loaded into the browser. 
The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.
That means if you want to access a property for the window it is window.property, if it is document it is window.document.property which is also available in short as document.property.
